## 2. Retrospective ##
1. Appreciations: Everyone is making good use of github branches to keep things out of main.
2. Successes: Members were able to work on separate tasks well.
3. Failures: Could have focused more on figuring out unit testing details.
4. Barriers: Time frame is limited for how much we want to get done.
5. What we should try next time: Keep focusing on implementation for newer puzzles.
