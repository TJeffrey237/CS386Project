## Project Ideas
We discussed various ideas for implementing a house flipper game based on completing different puzzles. We have potential ideas for tiling, electrical wiring, window jigsaw puzzles, moving furniture, and pipe mazes.
Godot will be the game engine used for this project andd the main scripting language will be GDscript. We are also interested in adding a story element to the game to add an extra layer of immersion.
