# Introduction #
Upkeep is a 2D-pixel art puzzle experience where players take on the role of a house renovator, selecting tasks and solving puzzles to restore a home for various owners. As an added aspect, players can also engage in minor storylines related to each house that is slowly uncovered throughout the renovation process. This game is primarily designed for simplicity in all aspects of gameplay such as puzzle completion, menu navigation, and the art style.

# Technology #
[Godot-4.4](https://godotengine.org/) - Godot is a very lightweight and simple game engine that utilizes an easy-to-pick-up Node and Scene system. The engine also has support for GDScript, C#, and C++ languages as well as extensive documentation for the creation of 2D-oriented game development.

[GUT](https://github.com/bitwes/Gut) - Plugin for the Godot game engine that provides tools to write and run unit tests for your game scripts. It enables developers to verify the correctness of their code by writing automated tests in GDScript. Integrates directly into the Godot editor, offering a test runner interface where you can easily execute tests, view results, and debug issues.

[Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) - Pixel art multitool that allows us to create sprites, tiles, and animations. Has a very simple UI design and has lots of support for autosaving, layers, export formats, and is fully free to utilize.

# UX Design #
For our UX design, we aimed to keep the game simple while staying true to our projectâ€™s theme. We focused on avoiding visual overload and overly complex tasks to create an intuitive and engaging experience. Our menu screen features a clean layout with distinctive navigation elements, ensuring ease of use. The in-game environment utilizes the same art style but also highlights objects that can be repaired when the user hovers over them so that it is easy to distinguish which tasks need to be completed. For our puzzle, we wanted to start off very simply with the classic jigsaw experience in an environment that felt reasonably realistic despite our abstract design which resulted in a task that involved repairing a broken window.

# Lessons Learned #
Looking at what we have released so far, there were a lot of issues we encountered throughout development. Moving into the future, coordinating our ideas for implementation will help to streamline the process and ensure that we all are on the same page when it comes to each idea we have. The biggest issue, however, is that we overestimated how much work we could achieve within the specified period which led to us being unable to implement some elements at the level of quality we wanted to. Essentially, communication is the main thing we hope to improve as we consider our next steps in terms of ideas, coding, and other areas of development.
