# Tests #
- You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:
- Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
- Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
- An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
- A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests. 

# Technology #
[Godot-4.4](https://godotengine.org/) - Godot is a very lightweight and simple game engine that utilizes an easy to pick up Node and Scene system. Engine also has support for GDScript, C#, and C++ languages as well as having extensive documentation for the creation of 2D oriented game development.

[doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) - Godot Engine allows to write unit tests directly in C++. The engine integrates the doctest unit testing framework which gives ability to write test suites and test cases next to production code.

[Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) - Pixel art multitool that allows us to create sprites, tiles, and animations. Has a very simpel UI design and has lots of support for autosaving, layers, export formats, and is fully free to utilize.

# UX Design #
For our UX design, we aimed to keep the game simple while staying true to our projectâ€™s theme. We focused on avoiding visual overload and overly complex tasks to create an intuitive and engaging experience. Our menu screen features a clean layout with distinctive navigation elements, ensuring ease of use. The in-game environment utilizes the same art style but also highlights objects that can be repaired when the user hovers over them so that it is easy to distinguish which tasks needed to be completed. For our puzzle, we wanted to start off very simple with the classic jigsaw experience in an environment that felt reasonably realistic despite our abstract design which resulted in a task that inolves repairing a broken window.

# Lessons Learned #
Looking at what we have released so far, there was a lot of issues we encountered throughout development. Moving into the future, coordinating our ideas for implementation will help to streamline the process and ensures that we all are on the same page when it comes to each idea we have. The biggest issue, however, is that we overestimated how much work we could achieve within the specified time period which led to us being unable to implement some elements at the level of quality we wanted to. Essentially, communication is the main thing we hope to improve as we consider our next steps in terms of ideas, coding, and other areas of development.
