# Introduction #
Provide a short paragraph that describes your system. This paragraph should contain the value proposition and a description of the main features of the software. At the end of the introduction, include a link to your project on GitHub.

# Requirements #
List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue, a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). I expect that you implement the features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). 

Order the requirements below by the name of the student who implemented them. All the members of the group should have worked on implementation activities and submitted pull requests. Only stable code should be included in the release. The code that is still under development should be in branches.

Example 1:
- Requirement: As a player, I want a jigsaw-type puzzle I can solve so that I can make progress in the game.

# Tests #
- You should implement automated tests that aim to verify the correct behavior of your code. Provide the following information:
- Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
- Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
- An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
- A print screen showing the result of the execution of the automated tests. 

# Technology #
[Godot-4.4](https://godotengine.org/) - Godot is a very lightweight and simple game engine that utilizes an easy to pick up Node and Scene system. Engine also has support for GDScript, C#, and C++ languages as well as having extensive documentation for the creation of 2D oriented game development.

[doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) - Godot Engine allows to write unit tests directly in C++. The engine integrates the doctest unit testing framework which gives ability to write test suites and test cases next to production code.

[Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama) - Pixel art multitool that allows us to create sprites, tiles, and animations. Has a very simpel UI design and has lots of support for autosaving, layers, export formats, and is fully free to utilize.
