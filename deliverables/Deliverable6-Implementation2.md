# Introduction #
Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This description should contain the value proposition and the main features. At the end of the introduction, include a link to your project on GitHub.

# Requirements #
List in this section, the requirements and associated pull request that you implemented for this release, following the example below---include the description of the requirement, a link to the issue,  a link to the pull request(s) that implement the requirement, who implemented the requirement, who approved it, and a print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable). Order the requirements by the name of the student who implemented them.

We expect that you implement/prototype the features you specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). We expect that all the members of the group have been involved in some programming activities and report here several pull requests. 

Example:
- Requirement: As a Student, I want to add a homework assignment so that I can organize my ToDo list.
- Issue: <link to your GitHub issue>
- Pull request: https://github.com/user/project/pull/426
- Implemented by: Martin Fowler
- Approved by: Ada Lovelace
- Print screen: A print screen that depicts the implemented feature (if applicable)

Remember that all source code should be submitted by means of pull requests and the quality assurance person in the team should review and approve each pull request. For more information about pull requests:

# Tests #
You should implement automated tests for the features described in the previous subsection. Provide the following information:
- Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit, unittest, pytest, etc.)
- Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are located.
- An example of a test case. Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to the test.
- A print screen showing the result of the automated tests execution. 

# Demo #
