# Description #
Upkeep is a 2D pixel art puzzle game that places players in the role of a house renovator. The core gameplay involves selecting renovation tasks and solving environment-based puzzles to restore homes for a variety of homeowners. With each house comes a unique set of puzzles and light storylines that are gradually revealed as the player progresses through the renovation process. Upkeep also emphasizes simplicity across all design aspects, including puzzle mechanics, user interface, and visual presentation. This approach allows for a greater range of accessibility between users while also engaging them in a simple and relaxing gameplay experience.

## Reflection ##
Looking at our interviews, there are a lot of things that we did correctly and some things that we may have failed to deliver on. In terms of art style and design, all users had a positive experience and found minimal things to either correct or change. Puzzles had a mixed reception with majority of it being positive, where users enjoyed the simplicity aspect of the experience and found it very easy to understand the core mechanics between scenes. Looking at what can be changed/added, it's a priority to add more visual/audible feedback for the users to help promote engagement with the game. It was also suggested that more puzzles be added to help extend the variety between objects. As for the learning curve, all users had no issues picking up and completing all parts of the game which falls directly in line with our intended goal of simplicity. Based on playthroughs, it was found that some of the users mistakenly tried to interact with irrelevant pieces of the puzzle while trying to intiially figure out mechanics, making this a small unexpected behavior. Based on our value proposition, we have successfully created the product we intended to make alongside lots of potential changes that can be made to improve the experience.
