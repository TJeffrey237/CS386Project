<h1>Deliverable 1</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Our team is developing a 2D puzzle-based house restoration game that blends technical puzzle mechanics with the creativity of home renovation and storytelling. The goal of this project is to deliver a mentally stimulating,   relaxing, and interactive experience that strays from the traditional constraints of the puzzle genre, which often fail to bridge multiple audiences and are unable to provide scalable creative experiences for players. By     offering a fresh approach to an underexplored gameplay concept, we aim to connect a diverse audience of casual players, puzzle enthusiasts, and home design fans, providing an experience that is both innovative and widely     appealing.
