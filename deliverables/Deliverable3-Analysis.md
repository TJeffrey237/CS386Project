# System Description #
The problem of repetitive puzzle games affects casual players; the impact of which is the loss of interest in the game and wasted development time. For casual players who enjoy puzzles, Upkeep is a game that combines the technical mechanics of puzzles with house restoration along with horror story elements. Unlike related games such as House Flipper, our product provides a more engaging experience that is less complicated and more invested in abstracting the precise details of house restoration. We achieve this goal of a structured, engaging, and creatively fulfilling house restoration experience by combining unique puzzle mechanics with interactive storytelling, guided renovation tasks, offering light customization options, clear objectives, and non-repetitive challenges.

Developers here will focus on maintaining a visually appealing and intuitive experience for players. Key functional requirements include the following: a consistent 2D pixelated art style, interactable **puzzle objects** for ***clickability***, ***sliding***, ***placing***, ***drawing***, and ***dragging***, **navigational buttons** for movement between screens, rooms, and other settings, and an overarching narrative that is implemented differently based on house. Key non-functional requirements include performance, scalability, saving systems, modularity, and a **server** such that Upkeep has the tools for smooth performance on a variety of hardware specifications, saving and loading progress between play sessions, accomodating for future expansions without large structural changes, codebase implementation in such a way to allow for easier debugging and scalability, and a defined architecture for implementation.
