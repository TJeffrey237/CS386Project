# System Description #
The problem of repetitive puzzle games affects casual players; the impact of which is the loss of interest in the game and wasted development time. For casual players who enjoy puzzles, Upkeep is a game that combines the technical mechanics of puzzles with house restoration along with horror story elements. Unlike related games such as House Flipper, our product provides a more engaging experience that is less complicated and more invested in abstracting the precise details of house restoration. We achieve this goal of a structured, engaging, and creatively fulfilling house restoration experience by combining unique puzzle mechanics with interactive storytelling, guided renovation tasks, offering light customization options, clear objectives, and non-repetitive challenges.
